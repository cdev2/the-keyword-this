/*
//We're in a job interview. Answer the following questions (try to not look at your notes unless you have to).
  // 1) What is the purpose of the 'this keyword'?

      //Answer
  
  //When used outside of a function it refers to the global object. When used inside of an object it refers to the object itself.
  
  // 2) What are the four rules that govern what the 'this keyword' is bound to and describe each?

      //Answer
1. Whenever a function is contained in the global scope, the value of this inside of that function will be the window object.

2. Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.

3. Whenever a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.

4. Whenever JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined. 

  // 3) What is the difference between call and apply?

      //Answer
A call uses arguements as objects seperated by commas whereas in apply the second arguement is an array which can contain the arguements
  // 4) What does .bind do?

Bind creates a new function that has its keyword this set to the value of the provided arguements when the new function is called.
      //Answer

//Next Problem

//Create an object called user which has the following properties.
  //username --> which is a string
  //email --> which is a string
  //getUsername --> which is a function that returns the current object's username property. *Don't use 'user' instead use the 'this' keyword*

    //Code Here

var user = {
  username: "bob",
  email: "bob@yahoo.com",
  getUsername: function(){
    return this.username
  }
}

//Now, invoke the getUsername method and verify you got the username of the object and not anything else.
user.getUsername()

//Next Problem


// Write a constructor function, including method definitions, which will make the following function invocations function properly.
function Car (make, model, yea,move){
  this.make = "make",
  this.model = 'model',
  this.year = 'year',
  this.moveCar = function(){
   return  this.move + 10;
  }
}
  //Function Invocations Here

var prius = new Car('Toyota', 'Prius', 2011, 50);
var mustang = new Car('Ford', 'Mustang', 2013, 50);

//Hint, you'll need to add a move property, with a starting value of zero, and write a moveCar function which will increment the move property by 10. The move property will be added to every object that is being returned from the Car function. You'll also need to use the 'this' keyword properly in order to make sure you're invoking moveCar on the right object (prius vs mustang).

prius.moveCar(); //increments prius' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.
mustang.moveCar(); //increments mustang' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.



//Continuation of previous problem

var getYear = function(){
  return this.year;
};

//Above you're given the getYear function. Call the getYear function with the prius then the mustang objects being the focal objects. *Don't add getYear as a property on both objects*.

//Note(no tests)
  //Code Here


//New Problem

var myUser = {
 username: 'iliketurtles',
 age: 13,
 email: 'iliketurtles@gmail.com'
};

var getMyUsername = function() {
 return this.username;
};

var userName = getMyUsername.call(myUser) //Fix this

//Above you're given an object, and  a function. What will the getMyUsername function return?
//Note(no tests)
  //Answer Here
iliketurtles
//In the example above, what is the 'this keyword' bound to when getMyUsername runs?

  //Answer Here
username

//Fix the getMyUsername invocation (stored in the userName variable, at the bottom of the above code) so that userName will be equal to 'iliketurtles'.
